ðŸš€ Potential Improvements:
1. Loading State & Empty States
Add loading indicators when filtering/sorting

Better empty state when no products match filters

Skeleton loading for product cards

2. User Experience Enhancements

Toast notifications - Better feedback when items are added to cart

Clear filters button - Easy way to reset all filters

Which improvements would you like me to implement first?
